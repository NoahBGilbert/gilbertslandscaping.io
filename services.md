<h2>Services</h2>
Our services include plant and shrub installation, weeding and laying mulch, lawn maintenance, yard debris removal, and general odd jobs related to lawn care or junk removal. I can provide all necessary materials (mulch, seeds, herbicides, etc.) at a wholesale price from local landscape material suppliers. 

Our rate for mowing lawns is a flat rate dependent on the size of the lawn. We can travel to most of the Middlesex county. Please contact me with any questions regarding service or availability. We are also open to performing various odd jobs depending on what they are.
